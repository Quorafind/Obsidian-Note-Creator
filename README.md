# Obsidian Note Creator

> [!note]
> This plugin was developed on behalf of [@sarah_a_bentley](https://twitter.com/Sarah_A_Bentley), and I am very grateful
> that she was willing to sponsor this plugin and allow me open source it to the community.

## Basic Usage

> [!warning]
> The current plugin requires the Templater plugin for an enhanced user experience.

1. When you type [[{Here is note title}, if you press $, it will display all Templater templates in real-time. If you
   select one and hit enter or press another key such as #, ^, or |, you will directly create a note based on that
   Templater template, and the note's title will be 'notetitle'.
2. When you type [[{Here is note title}, if you press $ and then type any character, you can press Shift+enter, or wait
   until a new prompt appears to create a note with tags and then press Enter. This will create a blank template, but it
   will automatically include the corresponding tags.
3. Similarly, you can perform this operation in the Property section.
